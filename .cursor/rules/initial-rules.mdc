this is a Angular material + electron + sqlite + typeorm project
Never use functions directly on html, this can cause angular bad performance
always save string as uppercase, unless user explicitly indicate another way
always edit .ts files that will compile and generate .js files, or edit both
Do not create a angular module for new components if i explicitly not ask to do, instead use the nearest module on path
when creating a filter form, do not implement filter on value changes unless user explicitly ask
Always remember that we have dark and light theme, so not use hardcored background colors
when creating a table, always align center all itens, only leave with align start names and descriptions
when creating a table do not add mat sort header unless user explicitly ask for
We are using Typeorm for with synchronize: true, we will change it later for production
